The report also indicates that the vessel was towed back to Honolulu Harbor by a sister vessel, but does not state which sister vessel this was. By examining the trajectories at the alleged time of the incident, we can clearly see that the tow vessel was the IRON LADY. Spatiotemporally concurrent data points between the SEEKER II and the IRON LADY appear in the AIS dataset starting almost precisely at 0:00 HST on 1/8/2017. These points came south of Oahu, as suggested in the report. However, it is clear that the tow was already taking place at the time of the alleged loss of propulsion event. Since the event was reported a week after the alleged took place (on 1/17/2017) the most logical conclusion would be that the precise time of the event was inaccurately reported and that it took place outside of the coastal bounding box.

There is little trajectory context, but it appears the vessel stayed stationary until 12/20 at around 14:00 at which point it returned to harbor. Hence it stayed in the same location following the event, which matches investigating and addressing the fire before returning. "

There is then a large gap in the AIS. On 12/23 at about 9:00 (1.5 hours after the LAURA ANN was taken in tow, according to the report) the SEA FALCON reappears a short distance northeast from to the position of the last broadcasted points of the of the LAURA ANN, and the trajectory heads straight to Honolulu Harbor. This is presumably the tow trajectory. Since the Laura Ann lost power, it only has 4 available points on the day of the event, which give a sense of the location of the incident. "
